MULTI-AGENT TRUST SIMULATION - BUILD EXECUTION LOG
============================================================

This log tracks every step taken by the coding agent to fulfill the simulation requirements.
All data is real and verifiable from public_citation_sources.csv.

[STEP 1] Loaded citation data from public_citation_sources.csv - 100 entries found
[STEP 2] Defined Ancestor scoring function with penalties for age, domain type, and bias keywords
[STEP 3] Starting 100-episode simulation with Claimant, Verifier, and Consumer agents
[STEP 4] Completed 100 episodes with trust scoring and decision logging
[STEP 5] Saving simulation results to results.csv
[STEP 6] Results saved with 100 episodes logged
[STEP 7] Creating matplotlib visualization of trust scores and acceptance decisions
[STEP 8] Visualization saved as trust_plot.png

[DONE] Simulation complete with all outputs generated.
