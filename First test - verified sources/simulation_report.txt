Date: 2025-10-21 13:26:53 UTC

Overview:
This simulation tested whether a deterministic, heuristic-based trust scoring engine (Ancestor) could influence agent behavior in a cooperative multi-agent setting. Three agent roles were simulated: a Claimant agent (selects citations), a Verifier agent (Ancestor engine scoring trustworthiness), and a Consumer agent (accepts or rejects based on score threshold).

Key Results:
- Total episodes simulated: 100
- Trust score acceptance threshold: 60
- Overall acceptance rate: 100.00%
- Average trust score: 96.59
- Score range: 83.88 – 99.97

Insights:
- All 100 claims were accepted due to scores exceeding the acceptance threshold.
- The dataset comprised only high-quality, real-world citations, verified manually.
- The Ancestor engine used a rule-based approach: penalizing source age, domain type, and perceived bias.
- The simulation demonstrates that cooperation (claim acceptance) can be sustained through deterministic trust evaluation, even in the absence of agent memory or learning.
