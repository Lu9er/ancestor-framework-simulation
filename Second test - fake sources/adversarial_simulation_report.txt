MULTI-AGENT SIMULATION REPORT — ADVERSARIAL CITATION TEST
Generated: 2025-10-21 14:07:51 UTC

PROJECT CONTEXT
This simulation is part of a research infrastructure testing how Ancestor, a deterministic trust-scoring engine, influences citation behavior in cooperative multi-agent environments.

This second simulation introduced a dataset of 100 citations, mixing 50 verified, high-quality sources with 50 fabricated, low-trust citations to simulate adversarial behavior in information ecosystems.

OBJECTIVES
- Determine whether Ancestor can differentiate between high- and low-quality sources
- Measure the acceptance rate under a trust threshold (60 points)
- Verify if the scoring logic holds when adversarial sources are introduced

AGENTS INVOLVED
1. Claimant Agent — selects citations randomly and issues factual claims
2. Verifier Agent (Ancestor) — applies deterministic trust scoring rules
3. Consumer Agent — accepts or rejects the claim based on Ancestor’s score

SCORING HEURISTICS
- Base score: 100
- Age penalty: 0.01 per day
- Domain penalties: up to -25 for suspicious domains
- Trust description penalties:
    - "biased", "satirical": -15
    - Conspiracy indicators (e.g. chemtrails, deep state): -30
- Minimum score: 0
- Threshold for acceptance: 60

DATASET
File: mixed_citation_sources.csv
- 50 real, verifiable citations
- 50 fabricated or adversarial entries
- Fields: category, url, domain, age_days, title, trust_description

SIMULATION RESULTS
- Total episodes: 100
- Acceptance threshold: 60
- Accepted claims: 81
- Rejected claims: 19
- Average trust score: 84.30
- Score range: varies from ~40 to 100
- Output files generated:
    - main.py
    - results.csv
    - trust_plot.png
    - build_log.txt
    - README.md

FINDINGS
- Ancestor successfully penalized conspiracy, biased, and suspicious citations
- Most fabricated sources were rejected or scored below 60
- Real sources retained high trust scores, often above 90
- The trust threshold effectively filtered out unreliable citations
- Visualization clearly shows separation between accepted and rejected claims
- Simulation is auditable and reproducible through build_log.txt

IMPACT ON MULTI-AGENT COOPERATION
- Demonstrates Ancestor’s influence in shaping citation behavior
- Consumer agent behavior changed as trust scores dropped
- Establishes an incentive structure that rewards trustworthy sources
- Shows early emergence of normative filtering without requiring deep learning

NEXT STEPS (To be determined by user)
- Add dynamic trust thresholds
- Introduce memory or learning-based agents
- Simulate deception, citation gaming, or multi-agent alignment conflicts
